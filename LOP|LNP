---------------------------- Common Issues ----------------------------

1. Lost parcel *Might be obsolete as they can do themselves (LOP > Exception Handling > Lost Parcel V1/V2?)

- Confirm that parcel is lost
- Send an email to the head of territory for approval of lost parcel
- Raise tickets in GOC

2. Update status to Handed_over_to_3PL

- Check what is the current status in LOP and LNP
    - Ask if they have tried to use Sort > 3PL Handover (this is the correct SOP)
        - Try to do 
- If LNP has successfully delivered (or status is with 3PL), can straight away raise ticket in GOC
- If LNP status is still not with 3PL, need approval from HOT/HOR AND a copy of manifest (dont want excel)

3. LOP Mobile App

- Kill and force stop app 
- Report the issue, provide name and ID of the courier
- Report to dev (Phat Nguyen)
